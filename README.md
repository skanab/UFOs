# UFOs

## Overview
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended. Still, she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. This project will add the additional city, state, country, and shape filters. It will be no less than impressive once completed.

## Results
The project team implemented the additional filtering. The users are now able to filter on any of the five different criteria. Filters are cumulative and allow the user to drill down into the results that they need. As expected, the users have been very impressed.

Inital page with unfiltered data:

The user has filtered by 'el cajon' their city of interest due to the little green men's many visits.

## Summary
### Known Issues
* No white space trimming. Extra spaces result in misleading results.
* City, State, Country, and Shape should be dynamically-populated drop-down lists from the data provided.

### Future enhancements
* Add a clear all filers button to the page.
* Allow users to access data and filter via API.
* Allow users to download CSV files of their filtered results.
* Add ability to filter by table headers. This functionality would allow the user to sort the columns.
* Relies on static data provided. Integration into the data source would allow for the site to be always up to date without intervention.
* Missing social aspect. New sightings should be posted to social networks with hashtags of City, State, and Country to alert UFO followers.
